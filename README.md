iNeed Authentication Inspector
========================

Description
--------------
A utility for eRMS developers developing on their local machine.

It inspects the network traffic generated when logging into eRMS via iNeed and then exposes the authentication data via a browser action.  The developer can then copy that data into the authentication fields when logging into his local machine.
